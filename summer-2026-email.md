**Subject:** Summer 2026 Registration Open — Meet Our New Cubs Coaches! 🐻


---


Hi everyone!

Summer 2026 registration is officially open for **Bears Track Club**, and we have some exciting news to share!


## 🌟 Introducing Our Summer Cubs Coaching Staff

**Laura Sturgeon** and **Kristi Steeger** are joining Bears TC as our **Summer Cubs coaches**, and we couldn't be more excited about this pair. **Kristi has been the Head Cross Country and Track & Field coach at Monument Academy since 2018** — she knows this community, she knows these age groups, and she knows how to develop young runners. Laura brings the same passion and energy for youth athletics. Both are USATF & SafeSport certified. Your kids are in great hands.

**Summer Cubs** is for ages 7–11. It runs **Monday & Thursday, 8:15–10:00 AM, June 1 through August 7.**

If your child has been running through school, rec, or another elementary program, Cubs is the natural next step — it bridges the gap between casual youth running and the more structured training they'll see in middle and high school. Cubs builds speed, agility, coordination, and endurance through games, relays, and team activities so kids stay engaged and actually want to come back. It's real athletic development disguised as fun, and the skills they build here set the foundation for Summer Bears and beyond.

Every athlete gets a Cubs T-shirt. Pricing is **$165 for the first child**, **$95 for each additional sibling** (42% off), and **4th+ children are FREE**.
