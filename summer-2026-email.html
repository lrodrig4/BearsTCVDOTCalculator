    <p>Hi everyone!</p>

    <p>Summer 2026 registration is officially open for <strong>Bears Track Club</strong>, and we have some exciting news
        to share!</p>

    <h2>🌟 Introducing Our Summer Cubs Coaching Staff</h2>

    <p><strong>Laura Sturgeon</strong> and <strong>Kristi Steeger</strong> are joining Bears TC as our <strong>Summer
            Cubs coaches</strong>, and we couldn't be more excited about this pair. <strong>Kristi has been the Head
            Cross Country and Track & Field coach at Monument Academy since 2018</strong> — she knows this community,
        she knows these age groups, and she knows how to develop young runners. Laura brings the same passion and energy
        for youth athletics. Both are USATF & SafeSport certified. Your kids are in great hands.</p>

    <p><strong>Summer Cubs</strong> is for ages 7–11. It runs <strong>Monday & Thursday, 8:15–10:00 AM, June 1 through
            August 7.</strong></p>

    <p>If your child has been running through school, rec, or another elementary program, Cubs is the natural next step
        — it bridges the gap between casual youth running and the more structured training they'll see in middle and
        high school. Cubs builds speed, agility, coordination, and endurance through games, relays, and team activities
        so kids stay engaged and actually want to come back. It's real athletic development disguised as fun, and the
        skills they build here set the foundation for Summer Bears and beyond.</p>

    <p>Every athlete gets a Cubs T-shirt. Pricing is <strong>$165 for the first child</strong>, <strong>$95 for each
            additional sibling</strong> (42% off), and <strong>4th+ children are FREE</strong>.</p>
