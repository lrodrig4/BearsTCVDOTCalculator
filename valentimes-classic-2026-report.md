# Bears TC — Valentimes Classic Indoor Performance Report
**February 14, 2026 · Air Force Academy**

## How We Measured Progress

Indoor track events (300m, 600m, 1000m, 2400m) don't have exact outdoor equivalents. To compare today's indoor performances against each athlete's outdoor personal records, we used the **Riegel conversion formula** — the same methodology behind the USTFCCCA scoring tables used in college track & field.

**What it does:** It converts a time from one distance to a predicted equivalent at another distance, accounting for the natural slowdown that occurs as race distance increases.

**Conversions used today:**

| Indoor Event | Converts To | Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| 300m | → 400m | × 1.357 |
| 600m | → 800m | × 1.357 |
| 1000m | → 800m | × 0.789 |
| 1000m | → 1600m | × 1.646 |
| 2400m | → 3200m | × 1.357 |

> **Note:** Indoor tracks are 200m with tight turns, which naturally adds time compared to outdoor. These conversions are *conservative* — athletes will likely run even faster outdoors on a full 400m track.

## 🌟 Athletes of the Meet — Progress You Might Not See in the Standings

These athletes may not have finished at the top of the overall results, but their performances tell a bigger story:

### Aaden Clark — 600m: 1:31.81 (4th)
At last year's Valentimes meet, Aaden ran the 600m in 1:41.46 and finished 13th. Today he ran **1:31.81 and finished 4th** — a 9.65-second improvement. His 600m converts to a 2:04 800m, which is already 3 seconds faster than his outdoor personal best. Aaden went from the back of the pack to competing with the top of the field in 12 months.

### Justin Saglembeni — 600m: 1:50.49, 300m: 46.40
At last year's Valentimes, Justin ran the 1000m in 3:40.03 and the following week ran a 2:44.75 indoor 800m. Today his 600m converts to a **2:29 800m** and his 300m to a **1:03 400m** — his outdoor 400m PB was 1:11. That's an 8-second improvement in the 400m equivalent and a 15-second improvement in the 800m equivalent. Justin is a completely different athlete from a year ago.

### Chloe Allen — 600m: 2:02.58, 300m: 53.04
Chloe's 600m converts to a **2:46 800m** — her outdoor PR was 2:52. Her 300m converts to a **1:12 400m** — her outdoor PR was 1:17. That's 5-6 seconds faster across both events. She ran 15:15 at the MS State XC Championships this fall, and you can see that endurance base paying off in shorter indoor races now.

### Ethan Hummel — 1000m: 3:24.30
Last year Ethan ran the 1000m at Valentimes in 3:33.43. Today he ran **3:24.30** — a 9-second improvement. His 1000m converts to match his outdoor 800m PB (2:41) and project a 1600m 3.7 seconds faster than his outdoor best. For a 7th grader, that kind of indoor-to-indoor jump is how future varsity runners are built.

### Ronin Smith — 1000m: 2:56.62 (3rd)
Ronin had a 59.81 outdoor 400m last spring at Monument Academy and **no 800m or 1600m on record**. In his first indoor season, he ran a 1000m that converts to a **2:19 800m and a 4:50 1600m** — and he finished 3rd, ahead of upperclassmen. One week ago his indoor 1600m was 5:02. He dropped the equivalent of 12 seconds in 7 days. This is what happens when XC fitness meets real speed training for the first time.

### Helen Ostrowski — 1000m: 3:33.86
Helen's 1000m converts to a **5:51 1600m** — her outdoor PR was 6:02. That's a 10-second projected improvement. Last year at Valentimes she ran the 2000m in 8:17 — her 1000m this year converts to 24.8 seconds faster than what that 2000m would predict. She's gone from a middle-of-the-pack MS runner to someone projecting serious freshman times.

### Leo Mason — 1000m: 3:42.11
Leo's 1000m converts to a **6:05 1600m**. His outdoor 1600m PR? **6:41.** That's a 36-second projected improvement. His 300m converts to a 400m that's 5.6 seconds faster than his outdoor PR. Leo is quietly making one of the biggest jumps on the entire team.

## The Big Picture

**14 of 17 returning athletes are converting at or ahead of their outdoor personal records — in mid-February, indoors, on a tight 200m track.** That doesn't happen by accident. The combination of fall cross country base, structured winter training, and targeted indoor racing is producing measurable results across the board.

Outdoor season starts in March. These indoor performances are the foundation.
